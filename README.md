# Scheduler
Sam Pastoriza and Luwen Zhang
To run the schedule app, make sure that angular js, including the angular routing js is downloaded in a node-modules package. Also make sure bootstrap is included, and that express is included. To run the application, run nodemon on server.js and navigate most likely to localhost:3000 on your browser. There you should find the schedule page.
